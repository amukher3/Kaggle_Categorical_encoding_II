# Kaggle_Categorical_encoding_II
This repository details the scripts used in the Kaggle challenge

`Attained public score:0.72`
`Attained private score:0.73`

`Highest achieved public and private score in the leader-board:0.78`

The data-set had some null values this was the only difference between
`Categorical encoding I` and `Categorical encdding II` data-sets.

The model was a simple feed-forward net. After some data cleaning and
some feature engineering the model produced decent results.

Some Exploratory data-analysis reveal some of the corners and reasons used
for feature engineering.
